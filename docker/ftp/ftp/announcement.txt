Staff Annoucement!

We are now diverting all resources to project codename Stellavirus. This has meant our security teams have stopped the upgrade of our website. Please can we ensure we are using strong passwords, I have a list of passwords and I am disappointed to see some of you using passwords common enough to appear on this list! 

Until this project is complete. Myself and the intern managing the website shall have admin access to the website.

Regards,

~ Manager
